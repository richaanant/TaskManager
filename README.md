Task Management System
Description This Java-based system is designed to manage the user to add, remove, modify, categorize, and recurring tasks. The system uses object oriented programming principles for handling of multiple kinds of tasks.

Features: 
Add: Adds the task object which, if it is found it prints all the attributes of tasks that were found, which will print “Task did not added, it is already found”. And if it is not found, then it adds all the attributes of tasks that were not found, which will print “Task added successfully”. 

Remove: Removes the task which basically if all attributes are found, then it will be removed which will print “Task is removed successfully”; If it is not found, than print “Task is not removed successfully. 

Modify: Modifies the task which changes the attributes of the task to a new value which will print “Task is modified successfully”

Categorize: Categorizes the task which categorizes based on the range of the priority of importance of the task and priority has to to be in the range of -1 < 0 < 1 or else it will print “Error, out of range bounds”. -1 is low priority, 0 is middle priority, and 1 is high priority.

Recurring: Recurrs the task what needs to be needs weekly.
